## Creational patterns 

### Singleton Pattern
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

### Builder Pattern

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

### Prototype Pattern
Specify the kind of objects to create using the prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

For classes use inheritance.

### Factory Pattern
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Methods lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
