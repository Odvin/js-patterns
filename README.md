## Creational patterns 

### Singleton
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

### Builder

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

### Prototype
Specify the kind of objects to create using the prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

For classes use inheritance.

### Factory
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Methods lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## Structural Patterns

### Adapter
Convert the interface of a class into another clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### Proxy Pattern
Provide a surrogate or palceholder for another object to control access to it.

### Composites
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
